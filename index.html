                <h2>What is COVID-19 ?</h2>
                <p>Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans,
                    coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that can be mild, such as some cases of the common
                    cold (among other possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses), and others that can be lethal, such
                    as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper
                    respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are yet to be vaccines
                    or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.

                <h2>Wash hand frequently</h2>
                <p>Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. The CDC recommends that people wash
                    hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or
                    when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. It
                    further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when
                    soap and water are not readily available.[287] The WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes,
                    nose, or mouth with unwashed hands

                <h2>Always wear mask</h2>
                <p>Surgical masks in the community are only helpful in preventing people who have coronavirus disease
                    from spreading it to others.
                    If you are well, you do not need to wear a surgical mask. There is little evidence that widespread
                    use of surgical masks in healthy people prevents transmission in public.

                <h2>Avoid to touch eye & mouth</h2>
                <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) says we should particularly try to avoid touching the eyes, nose
                    and mouth, which can be an effective way of halting the spread of diseases. Viruses can live for
                    days on surfaces from desktops to door handles, and once on our hands can be transferred into our
                    bodies through these entry points.

                <h2>Stay at home</h2>
                <p>Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect
                    they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper
                    self-isolation.Additionally, many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for
                    entire populations
                    living in affected areas.The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to
                    those in high risk groups. Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who
                    have recently travelled to a country.
